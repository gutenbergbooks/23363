    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was close upon eleven o'clock when I stepped out of the rear vestibule
      of the Boston Theatre, and, passing through the narrow court that leads to
      West Street, struck across the Common diagonally. Indeed, as I set foot on
      the Tremont Street mall, I heard the Old South drowsily sounding the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tranquil June night, with no moon, but clusters of sensitive
      stars that seemed to shiver with cold as the wind swept by them; for
      perhaps there was a swift current of air up there in the zenith. However,
      not a leaf stirred on the Common; the foliage hung black and massive, as
      if cut in bronze; even the gaslights appeared to be infected by the
      prevailing calm, burning steadily behind their glass screens and turning
      the neighboring leaves into the tenderest emerald. Here and there, in the
      sombre row of houses stretching along Beacon Street, an illuminated window
      gilded a few square feet of darkness; and now and then a footfall sounded
      on a distant pavement. The pulse of the city throbbed languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights far and near, the fantastic shadows of the elms and maples, the
      gathering dew, the elusive odor of new grass, and that peculiar hush which
      belongs only to midnight&mdash;as if Time had paused in his flight and
      were holding his breath&mdash;gave to the place, so familiar to me by day,
      an air of indescribable strangeness and remoteness. The vast, deserted
      park had lost all its wonted outlines; I walked doubtfully on the
      flagstones which I had many a time helped to wear smooth; I seemed to be
      wandering in some lonely unknown garden across the seas&mdash;in that old
      garden in Verona where Shakespeare's ill-starred lovers met and parted.
      The white granite fa√ßade over yonder&mdash;the Somerset Club&mdash;might
      well have been the house of Capulet: there was the clambering vine
      reaching up like a pliant silken ladder; there, near by, was the low-hung
      balcony, wanting only the slight girlish figure&mdash;immortal shape of
      fire and dew!&mdash;to make the illusion perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know what suggested it; perhaps it was something in the play I
      had just witnessed&mdash;it is not always easy to put one's finger on the
      invisible electric thread that runs from thought to thought&mdash;but as I
      sauntered on I fell to thinking of the ill-assorted marriages I had known.
      Suddenly there hurried along the gravelled path which crossed mine
      obliquely a half-indistinguishable throng of pathetic men and women: two
      by two they filed before me, each becoming startlingly distinct for an
      instant as they passed&mdash;some with tears, some with hollow smiles, and
      some with firm-set lips, bearing their fetters with them. There was little
      Alice chained to old Bowlsby; there was Lucille, &ldquo;a daughter of the gods,
      divinely tall,&rdquo; linked forever to the dwarf Perrywinkle; there was my
      friend Porphyro, the poet, with his delicate genius shrivelled in the
      glare of the youngest Miss Lucifer's eyes; there they were, Beauty and the
      Beast, Pride and Humility, Bluebeard and Fatima, Prose and Poetry, Riches
      and Poverty, Youth and Crabbed Age&mdash; Oh, sorrowful procession! All so
      wretched, when perhaps all might have been so happy if they had only
      paired differently! I halted a moment to let the weird shapes drift by. As
      the last of the train melted into the darkness, my vagabond fancy went
      wandering back to the theatre and the play I had seen&mdash;Romeo and
      Juliet. Taking a lighter tint, but still of the same sober color, my
      reflections continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a different kind of woman Juliet would have been if she had not
      fallen in love with Romeo, but had bestowed her affection on some
      thoughtful and stately signior&mdash;on one of the Delia Scalas, for
      example! What Juliet needed was a firm and gentle hand to tame her high
      spirit without breaking a pinion. She was a little too&mdash;vivacious,
      you might say&mdash;&ldquo;gushing&rdquo; would perhaps be the word if you were
      speaking of a modern maiden with so exuberant a disposition as Juliet's.
      She was too romantic, too blossomy, too impetuous, too wilful; old Capulet
      had brought her up injudiciously, and Lady Capulet was a nonentity. Yet in
      spite of faults of training and some slight inherent flaws of character,
      Juliet was a superb creature; there was a fascinating dash in her
      frankness; her modesty and daring were as happy rhymes as ever touched
      lips in a love-poem. But her impulses required curbing; her heart made too
      many beats to the minute. It was an evil destiny that flung in the path of
      so rich and passionate a nature a fire-brand like Romeo. Even if no family
      feud had existed, the match would not have been a wise one. As it was, the
      well-known result was inevitable. What could come of it but clandestine
      meetings, secret marriage, flight, despair, poison, and the Tomb of the
      Capulets? I had left the park behind, by this, and had entered a
      thoroughfare where the street-lamps were closer together; but the gloom of
      the trees seemed still to be overhanging me. The fact is, the tragedy had
      laid a black finger on my imagination. I wished that the play had ended a
      trifle more cheerfully. I wished&mdash;possibly because I see enough
      tragedy all around me without going to the theatre for it, or possibly it
      was because the lady who enacted the leading part was a remarkably
      clean-cut little person, with a golden sweep of eyelashes&mdash;I wished
      that Juliet could have had a more comfortable time of it. Instead of a
      yawning sepulchre, with Romeo and Juliet dying in the middle foreground,
      and that luckless young Paris stretched out on the left, spitted like a
      spring-chicken with Montague's rapier, and Friar Laurence, with a dark
      lantern, groping about under the melancholy yews&mdash;in place of all
      this costly piled-up woe, I would have liked a pretty, mediaeval chapel
      scene, with illuminated stained-glass windows, and trim acolytes holding
      lighted candles, and the great green curtain slowly descending to the
      first few bars of the Wedding March of Mendelssohn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Shakespeare was true to the life in making them all die
      miserably. Besides, it was so they died in the novel of Matteo Bandello,
      from which the poet indirectly took his plot. Under the circumstances no
      other climax was practicable; and yet it was sad business. There were
      Mercutio, and Tybalt, and Paris, and Juliet, and Romeo, come to a bloody
      end in the bloom of their youth and strength and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghosts of these five murdered persons seemed to be on my track as I
      hurried down Revere Street to West Cedar. I fancied them hovering around
      the corner opposite the small drug-store, where a meagre apothecary was in
      the act of shutting up the fan-like jets of gas in his shop-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Master Booth,&rdquo; I muttered in the imagined teeth of the tragedian,
      throwing an involuntary glance over my shoulder, &ldquo;you 'll not catch me
      assisting at any more of your Shakespearean revivals. I would rather eat a
      pair of Welsh rarebits or a segment of mince-pie at midnight than sit
      through the finest tragedy that was ever writ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I said this I halted at the door of a house in Charles Place, and was
      fumbling for my latch-key, when a most absurd idea came into my head. I
      let the key slip back into my pocket, and strode down Charles Place into
      Cambridge Street, and across the long bridge, and then swiftly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember, vaguely, that I paused for a moment on the draw of the bridge,
      to look at the semi-circular fringe of lights duplicating itself in the
      smooth Charles in the rear of Beacon Street&mdash;as lovely a bit of
      Venetian effect as you will get outside of Venice; I remember meeting,
      farther on, near a stiff wooden church in Cambridgeport, a lumbering
      covered wagon, evidently from Brighton and bound for Quincy Market; and
      still farther on, somewhere in the vicinity of Harvard Square and the
      college buildings, I recollect catching a glimpse of a policeman, who,
      probably observing something suspicious in my demeanor, discreetly walked
      off in an opposite direction. I recall these trifles indistinctly, for
      during this preposterous excursion I was at no time sharply conscious of
      my surroundings; the material world presented itself to me as if through a
      piece of stained glass. It was only when I had reached a neighborhood
      where the houses were few and the gardens many, a neighborhood where the
      closely-knitted town began to fringe out into country, that I came to the
      end of my dream. And what was the dream? The slightest of tissues, madam;
      a gossamer, a web of shadows, a thing woven out of starlight. Looking at
      it by day, I find that its colors are pallid, and its threaded diamonds&mdash;they
      were merely the perishable dews of that June night&mdash;have evaporated
      in the sunshine; but such as it is you shall have it.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young prince Hamlet was not happy at Elsinore. It was not because he
      missed the gay student-life of Wittenberg, and that the little Danish
      court was intolerably dull. It was not because the didactic lord
      chamberlain bored him with long speeches, or that the lord chamberlain's
      daughter was become a shade wearisome. Hamlet had more serious cues for
      unhappiness. He had been summoned suddenly from Wittenberg to attend his
      father's funeral; close upon this, and while his grief was green, his
      mother had married with his uncle Claudius, whom Hamlet had never liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indecorous haste of these nuptials&mdash;they took place within two
      months after the king's death, the funeral-baked meats, as Hamlet
      cursorily remarked, furnishing forth the marriage-tables&mdash;struck the
      young prince aghast. He had loved the queen his mother, and had nearly
      idolized the late king; but now he forgot to lament the death of the one
      in contemplating the life of the other. The billing and cooing of the
      newly-married couple filled him with horror. Anger, shame, pity, and
      despair seized upon him by turns. He fell into a forlorn condition,
      forsaking his books, eating little save of the chameleon's dish, the air,
      drinking deep of Rhenish, letting his long, black locks go unkempt, and
      neglecting his dress&mdash;he who had hitherto been &ldquo;the glass of fashion
      and the mould of form,&rdquo; as Ophelia had prettily said of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often for half the night he would wander along the ramparts of the castle,
      at the imminent risk of tumbling off, gazing seaward and muttering
      strangely to himself, and evolving frightful spectres out of the shadows
      cast by the turrets. Sometimes he lapsed into a gentle melancholy; but not
      seldom his mood was ferocious, and at such times the conversational
      Polonius, with a discretion that did him credit, steered clear of my lord
      Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned no more graceful compliments for Ophelia. The thought of
      marrying her, if he had ever seriously thought of it, was gone now. He
      rather ruthlessly advised her to go into a nunnery. His mother had
      sickened him of women. It was of her he spoke the notable words, &ldquo;Frailty,
      thy name is woman!&rdquo; which, some time afterwards, an amiable French
      gentleman had neatly engraved on the head-stone of his wife, who had long
      been an invalid. Even the king and queen did not escape Hamlet in his
      distempered moments. Passing his mother in a corridor or on a staircase of
      the palace, he would suddenly plant a verbal dagger in her heart; and
      frequently, in full court, he would deal the king such a cutting reply as
      caused him to blanch, and gnaw his lip. If the spectacle of Gertrude and
      Claudius was hateful to Hamlet, the presence of
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet, on the other hand, was scarcely a comfort to the royal lovers. At
      first his uncle had called him &ldquo;our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our
      son,&rdquo; trying to smooth over matters; but Hamlet would have none of it.
      Therefore, one day, when the young prince abruptly announced his intention
      to go abroad, neither the king nor the queen placed impediments in his
      way, though, some months previously, they had both protested strongly
      against his returning to Wittenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small-fry of the court knew nothing of Prince Hamlet's determination
      until he had sailed from Elsinore; their knowledge then was confined to
      the fact of his departure. It was only to Horatio, his fellow-student and
      friend, that Hamlet confided the real cause of his self-imposed exile,
      though perhaps Ophelia half suspected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polonius had dropped an early hint to his daughter concerning Hamlet's
      intent. She knew that everything was over between them, and the night
      before he embarked Ophelia placed in the prince's hand the few letters and
      trinkets he had given her, repeating, as she did so, a certain distich
      which somehow haunted Hamlet's memory for several days after he was on
      shipboard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Take these again; for to the noble mind
     Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These could never have waxed poor,&rdquo; said Hamlet softly to himself, as he
      leaned over the taffrail, the third day out, spreading the trinkets in his
      palm, &ldquo;being originally of but little worth. I fancy that that allusion to
      'rich gifts' was a trifle malicious on the part of the fair Ophelia;&rdquo; and
      he quietly dropped them into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as a Danish gentleman voyaging for pleasure, and for mental profit
      also, if that should happen, that Hamlet set forth on his travels. Settled
      destination he had none, his sole plan being to get clear of Denmark as
      speedily as possible, and then to drift whither his fancy took him. His
      fancy naturally took him southward, as it would have taken him northward
      if he had been a Southron. Many a time while climbing the bleak crags
      around Elsinore he had thought of the land of the citron and the palm;
      lying on his couch at night, and listening to the wind as it howled along
      the machicolated battlements of the castle, his dreams had turned from the
      cold, blonde ladies of his father's court to the warmer beauties that
      ripen under sunny skies. He was free now to test the visions of his
      boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it chanced, after various wanderings, all tending imperceptibly in one
      direction, that Hamlet bent his steps towards Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those rude days one did not accomplish a long journey without having
      wonderful adventures befall, or encountering divers perils by the way. It
      was a period when a stout blade on the thigh was a most excellent
      travelling companion. Hamlet, though of a philosophical complexion, was
      not slower than another man to scent an affront; he excelled at feats of
      arms, and no doubt his skill, caught of the old fencing-master at
      Elsinore, stood him in good stead more than once when his wit would not
      have saved him. Certainly, he had hair-breadth escapes while toiling
      through the wilds of Prussia and Bavaria and Switzerland. At all events,
      he counted himself fortunate the night he arrived at Verona with nothing
      more serious than a two-inch scratch on his sword arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lodged himself, as became a gentleman of fortune, in a suite of
      chambers in a comfortable palace overlooking the swift-flowing Adige&mdash;a
      riotous yellow stream that cut the town into two parts, and was spanned
      here and there by rough-hewn stone bridges, which it sometimes sportively
      washed away. It was a brave old town that had stood sieges and plagues,
      and was full of mouldy, picturesque buildings and a gayety that has since
      grown somewhat mouldy. A goodly place to rest in for the wayworn pilgrim!
      He dimly recollected that he had letters to one or two illustrious
      families; but he cared not to deliver them at once. It was pleasant to
      stroll about the city, unknown. There were sights to see: the Roman
      amphitheatre, and the churches with their sculptured sarcophagi and
      saintly relics&mdash;interesting joints and saddles of martyrs, and enough
      fragments of the true cross to build a ship. The life in the <i>piazze</i>
      and on the streets, the crowds in the shops, the pageants, the lights, the
      stir, the color, all mightily took the eye of the young Dane. He was in a
      mood to be amused. Everything diverted him&mdash;the faint pulsing of a
      guitar-string in an adjacent garden at midnight, or the sharp clash of
      gleaming sword blades under his window, when the Montecchi and the
      Cappelletti chanced to encounter each other in the narrow footway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Hamlet brushed up his Italian. He was well versed in the
      literature of the language, particularly in its dramatic literature, and
      had long meditated penning a gloss to &ldquo;The Murther of Gonzago,&rdquo; a play
      which Hamlet held in deservedly high estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made acquaintances, too. In the same palace where he sojourned lived a
      very valiant soldier and wit, a kinsman to Prince Escalus, one Mercutio by
      name, with whom Hamlet exchanged civilities on the staircase at first, and
      then fell into companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of Verona's noble youths, poets and light-hearted men-about-town,
      frequented Mercutio's chambers, and with these Hamlet soon became on
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the rest were an agreeable gentleman, with hazel eyes, named
      Benvolio, and a gallant young fellow called Romeo, whom Mercutio bantered
      pitilessly and loved heartily. This Romeo, who belonged to one of the
      first families, was a very susceptible spark, which the slightest breath
      of a pretty woman was sufficient to blow into flame. To change the
      metaphor, he fell from one love affair into another as easily and
      logically as a ripe pomegranate drops from a bough. He was generally
      unlucky in these matters, curiously enough, for he was a handsome youth in
      his saffron satin doublet slashed with black, and his jaunty velvet bonnet
      with its trailing plume of ostrich feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of Hamlet's coming to Verona, Romeo was in a great despair of
      love in consequence of an unrequited passion for a certain lady of the
      city, between whose family and his own a deadly feud had existed for
      centuries. Somebody had stepped on somebody else's lap-dog in the far
      ages, and the two families had been slashing and hacking at each other
      ever since. It appeared that Romeo had scaled a garden wall, one night,
      and broken upon the meditations of his inamorata, who, as chance would
      have it, was sitting on her balcony enjoying the moonrise. No lady could
      be insensible to such devotion, for it would have been death to Romeo if
      any of her kinsmen had found him in that particular locality. Some tender
      phrases passed between them, perhaps; but the lady was flurried, taken
      unawares, and afterwards, it seemed, altered her mind, and would have no
      further commerce with the Montague. This business furnished Mercutio's
      quiver with innumerable sly shafts, which Romeo received for the most part
      in good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these three gentlemen&mdash;Mercutio, Benvolio, and Romeo&mdash;Hamlet
      saw life in Verona, as young men will see life wherever they happen to be.
      Many a time the nightingale ceased singing and the lark began before they
      were abed; but perhaps it is not wise to inquire too closely into this. A
      month had slipped away since Hamlet's arrival; the hyacinths were opening
      in the gardens, and it was spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as he and Mercutio were lounging arm in arm on a bridge near
      their lodgings, they met a knave in livery puzzling over a parchment which
      he was plainly unable to decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it aloud, friend!&rdquo; cried Mercutio, who always had a word to throw
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would I could read it at all. I pray, sir, can you read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With ease&mdash;if it is not my tailor's score;&rdquo; and Mercutio took the
      parchment, which ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Signior Martino, and his wife and daughters; County Ansdmo, and his
      beauteous sisters; the lady widow Vitrumo; Signior Placentio, and his
      lovely nieces; Mercutio, and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet,
      his wife and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio,
      and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio, and the lively Helena</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very select company, with the exception of that rogue Mercutio,&rdquo; said
      the soldier, laughing. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master, the Signior Capulet, gives a ball and supper to-night; these
      the guests; I am his man Peter, and if you be not one of the house of
      Montague, I pray come and crush a cup of wine with us. Rest you merry;&rdquo;
       and the knave, having got his billet deciphered for him, made off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must needs go, being asked by both man and master; but since I am
      asked doubly, I 'll not go singly; I 'll bring you with me, Hamlet. It is
      a masquerade; I have had wind of it. The flower of the city will be there&mdash;all
      the high-bosomed roses and low-necked lilies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet had seen nothing of society in Verona, properly speaking, and did
      not require much urging to assent to Mercutio's proposal, far from
      foreseeing that so slight a freak would have a fateful sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the night when they presented themselves, in mask and
      domino, at the Capulet mansion. The music was at its sweetest and the
      torches were at their brightest, as the pair entered the dancing-hall.
      They had scarcely crossed the threshold when Hamlet's eyes rested upon a
      lady clad in a white silk robe, who held to her features, as she moved
      through the figure of the dance, a white satin mask, on each side of which
      was disclosed so much of the rosy oval of her face as made one long to
      look upon the rest. The ornaments this lady wore were pearls; her fan and
      slippers, like the robe and mask, were white&mdash;nothing but white. Her
      eyes shone almost black contrasted with the braids of warm gold hair that
      glistened through a misty veil of Venetian stuff, which floated about her
      from time to time and enveloped her, as the blossoms do a tree. Hamlet
      could think of nothing but the almond-tree that stood in full bloom in the
      little <i>cortile</i> near his lodging. She seemed to him the incarnation
      of that exquisite spring-time which had touched and awakened all the
      leaves and buds in the sleepy old gardens around Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercutio! who is that lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of old Capulet, by her stature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he that dances with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris, a kinsman to Can Grande della Scala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to make a squadron; only the blind and aged are exempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the music ceased and the dancers dispersed. Hamlet followed the lady
      with his eyes, and, seeing her left alone a moment, approached her. She
      received him graciously, as a mask receives a mask, and the two fell to
      talking, as people do who&mdash;have nothing to say to each other and
      possess the art of saying it. Presently something in his voice struck on
      her ear, a new note, an intonation sweet and strange, that made her
      curious. Who was it? It could not be Valentine, nor Anselmo; he was too
      tall for Signior Placentio, not stout enough for Lucio; it was not her
      cousin Tybalt. Could it be that rash Montague who&mdash;Would he dare?
      Here, on the very points of their swords? The stream of maskers ebbed and
      flowed and surged around them, and the music began again, and Juliet
      listened and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, sir,&rdquo; she cried, at last, &ldquo;that speak our tongue with
      feigned accent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger; an idler in Verona, though not a gay one&mdash;a black
      butterfly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Italian sun will gild your wings for you. Black edged with gilt goes
      gay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am already not so sad-colored as I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would fain see your face, sir; if it match your voice, it needs must be
      a kindly one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would we could change faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we shall at supper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hearts, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I would not give a merry heart for a sorrowful one; but I will quit
      my mask, and you yours; yet,&rdquo; and she spoke under her breath, &ldquo;if you are,
      as I think, a gentleman of Verona&mdash;a Montague&mdash;do not unmask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not of Verona, lady; no one knows me here;&rdquo; and Hamlet threw back
      the hood of his domino. Juliet held her mask aside for a moment, and the
      two stood looking into each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, we have in faith changed faces, at least as I shall carry yours
      forever in my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I yours, sir,&rdquo; said Juliet, softly, &ldquo;wishing it looked not so pale
      and melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; whispered Mercutio, plucking at his friend's skirt, &ldquo;the fellow
      there, talking with old Capulet&mdash;his wife's nephew, Tybalt, a
      quarrelsome dog&mdash;suspects we are Montagues. Let us get out of this
      peaceably, like soldiers who are too much gentlemen to cause a brawl under
      a host's roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Mercutio pushed Hamlet to the door, where they were joined by
      Benvolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliet, with her eyes fixed upon the retreating maskers, stretched out her
      hand and grasped the arm of an ancient serving-woman who happened to be
      passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, good Nurse! go ask his name of yonder gentleman. Nay, not the one
      in green, dear! but he that hath the black domino and purple mask. What,
      did I touch your poor rheumatic arm? Ah, go now, sweet Nurse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Nurse hobbled off querulously on her errand, Juliet murmured to
      herself an old rhyme she knew:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;If he be married,
     My grave is like to be my wedding bed!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Hamlet got back to his own chambers he sat on the edge of his couch
      in a brown study. The silvery moonlight, struggling through the swaying
      branches of a tree outside the window, drifted doubtfully into the room,
      and made a parody of that fleecy veil which erewhile had floated about the
      lissome form of the lovely Capulet. That he loved her, and must tell her
      that he loved her, was a foregone conclusion; but how should he contrive
      to see Juliet again? No one knew him in Verona; he had carefully preserved
      his incognito; even Mercutio regarded him as simply a young gentleman from
      Denmark, taking his ease in a foreign city. Presented, by Mercutio, as a
      rich Danish tourist, the Capulets would receive him courteously, of
      course; as a visitor, but not as a suitor. It was in another character
      that he must be presented&mdash;his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pondering what steps he could take to establish his identity, when
      he remembered the two or three letters which he had stuffed into his
      wallet on quitting Elsi-nore. He lighted a taper, and began examining the
      papers. Among them were the half dozen billet-doux which Ophelia had
      returned to him the night before his departure. They were, neatly tied
      together by a length of black ribbon, to which was attached a sprig of
      rosemary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was just like Ophelia!&rdquo; muttered the young man, tossing the package
      into the wallet again; &ldquo;she was always having cheerful ideas like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How long ago seemed the night she had handed him these love-letters, in
      her demure little way! How misty and remote seemed everything connected
      with the old life at Elsinore! His father's death, his mother's marriage,
      his anguish and isolation&mdash;they were like things that had befallen
      somebody else. There was something incredible, too, in his present
      situation. Was he dreaming? Was he really in Italy, and in love?
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily bent forward and picked up a square folded paper lying half
      concealed under the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I have forgotten it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a missive addressed, in Horatio's angular hand, to the Signior
      Capulet of Verona, containing a few lines of introduction from Horatio,
      whose father had dealings with some of the rich Lombardy merchants and
      knew many of the leading families in the city. With this and several
      epistles, preserved by chance, written to him by Queen Gertrude while he
      was at the university, Hamlet saw that he would have no difficulty in
      proving to the Capulets that he was the Prince of Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an unseemly hour the next morning Mercutio was roused from his slumbers
      by Hamlet, who counted every minute a hundred years until he saw Juliet.
      Mercutio did not take this interruption too patiently, for the honest
      humorist was very serious as a sleeper; but his equilibrium was quickly
      restored by Hamlet's revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends were long closeted together, and at the proper, ceremonious
      hour for visitors they repaired to the house of Capulet, who did not hide
      his sense of the honor done him by the prince. With scarcely any prelude
      Hamlet unfolded the motive of his visit, and was listened to with rapt
      attention by old Capulet, who inwardly blessed his stars that he had not
      given his daughter's hand to the County Paris, as he was on the point of
      doing. The ladies were not visible on this occasion; the fatigues of the
      ball overnight, etc.; but that same evening Hamlet was accorded an
      interview with Juliet and Lady Capulet, and a few days subsequently all
      Verona was talking of nothing but the new engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destructive Tybalt scowled at first, and twirled his fierce mustache,
      and young Paris took to writing dejected poetry; but they both soon
      recovered their serenity, seeing that nobody minded them, and went
      together arm in arm to pay their respects to Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new life began now for Hamlet&mdash;-he shed his inky cloak, and came
      out in a doublet of insolent splendor, looking like a dagger-handle newly
      gilt. With his funereal gear he appeared to have thrown off something of
      his sepulchral gloom. It was impossible to be gloomy with Juliet, in whom
      each day developed some sunny charm un-guessed before. Her freshness and
      coquettish candor were constant surprises. She had had many lovers, and
      she confessed them to Hamlet in the prettiest way. &ldquo;Perhaps, my dear,&rdquo; she
      said to him one evening, with an ineffable smile, &ldquo;I might have liked
      young Romeo very well, but the family were so opposed to it from the very
      first. And then he was so&mdash;so demonstrative, don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet had known of Romeo's futile passion, but he had not been aware
      until then that his betrothed was the heroine of the balcony adventure. On
      leaving Juliet he-went to look up the Montague; not for the purpose of
      crossing rapiers with him, as another man might have done, but to
      compliment him on his unexceptionable taste in admiring so rare a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Romeo had disappeared in a most unaccountable manner, and his family
      were in great tribulation concerning him. It was thought that perhaps the
      unrelenting Rosaline (who had been Juliet's frigid predecessor) had
      relented, and Montague's man Abram was dispatched to seek Romeo at her
      residence; but the Lady Rosaline, who was embroidering on her piazza,
      placidly denied all knowledge of him. It was then feared that he had
      fallen in one of the customary encounters; but there had been no fight,
      and nobody had been killed on either side for nearly twelve hours.
      Nevertheless, his exit had the appearance of being final. When Hamlet
      questioned Mercutio, the honest soldier laughed and stroked his blonde
      mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy has gone off in a heat, I don't know where&mdash;to the icy ends
      of the earth, I believe, to cool himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet regretted that Romeo should have had any feeling in the matter; but
      regret was a bitter weed that did not thrive well in the atmosphere in
      which the fortunate lover was moving. He saw Juliet every day, and there
      was not a fleck upon his happiness, unless it was the garrulous Nurse,
      against whom Hamlet had taken a singular prejudice. He considered her a
      tiresome old person, not too decent in her discourse at times, and advised
      Juliet to get rid of her; but the ancient serving-woman had been in the
      family for years, and it was not quite expedient to discharge her at that
      late day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the subtile penetration of old age the Nurse instantly detected
      Hamlet's dislike, and returned it heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ladybird,&rdquo; she cried one night, &ldquo;ah, well-a-day! you know not how to
      choose a man. An I could choose for you, Jule! By God's lady, there's
      Signior Mercutio, a brave gentleman, a merry gentleman, and a virtuous, I
      warrant ye, whose little finger-joint is worth all the body of this
      blackbird prince, dropping down from Lord knows where to fly off with the
      sweetest bit of flesh in Verona. Marry, come up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was only a ripple on the stream that flowed so smoothly. Now and
      then, indeed, Hamlet felt called upon playfully to chide Juliet for her
      extravagance of language, as when, for instance, she prayed that when he
      died he might be cut out in little stars to deck the face of night. Hamlet
      objected, under any circumstances, to being cut out in little stars for
      any illuminating purposes whatsoever. Once she suggested to her lover that
      he should come to the garden after the family retired, and she would speak
      with him a moment from the balcony. Now, as there was no obstacle to their
      seeing each other whenever they pleased, and as Hamlet was of a nice sense
      of honor, and since his engagement a most exquisite practicer of
      propriety, he did not encourage Juliet in her thoughtlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, lifting his finger at her reprovingly, &ldquo;romantic again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was their nearest approach to a lovers' quarrel. The next day Hamlet
      brought her, as peace-offering, a slender gold flask curiously wrought in
      niello, which he had had filled with a costly odor at an apothecary's as
      he came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw so lean a thing as that same culler of simples,&rdquo; said Hamlet,
      laughing; &ldquo;a matter of ribs and shanks, a mere skeleton painted black. It
      is a rare essence, though. He told me its barbaric botanical name, but it
      escapes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which we call a rose,&rdquo; said Juliet, holding the perfumery to her
      nostrils and inclining herself prettily towards him, &ldquo;would smell as sweet
      by any other name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O Youth and Love! O fortunate Time!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a banquet almost every night at the Capulets', and the
      Montagues, up the street, kept their blinds drawn down, and Lady Montague,
      who had four marriageable, tawny daughters on her hands, was livid with
      envy at her neighbor's success. She would rather have had two or three
      Montagues prodded through the body than that the prince should have gone
      to the rival house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Prince!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and Laertes, and the rest of the dismal
      people at Elsinore, could have seen him now, they would not have known
      him. Where were his wan looks and biting speeches? His eyes were no longer
      filled with mournful speculation. He went in glad apparel, and took the
      sunshine as his natural inheritance. If he ever fell into moodiness&mdash;it
      was partly constitutional with him&mdash;the shadow fled away at the first
      approach of that &ldquo;loveliest weight on lightest foot.&rdquo; The sweet Veronese
      had nestled in his empty heart, and filled it with music. The ghosts and
      visions that used to haunt him were laid forever by Juliet's magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Juliet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her beauty had taken a new gloss. The bud bad grown into a flower,
      redeeming the promises of the bud. If her heart beat less wildly, it
      throbbed more strongly. If she had given Hamlet of her superabundance of
      spirits, he had given her of his wisdom and discretion. She had always
      been a great favorite in society; but Verona thought her ravishing now.
      The mantua-makers cut their dresses by her patterns, and when she wore
      turquoise, garnets went ont of style. Instead of the groans and tears, and
      all those distressing events which might possibly have happened if Juliet
      had persisted in loving Romeo&mdash;listen to her laugh and behold her
      merry eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning either Peter or Gregory might have been seen going up
      Hamlet's staircase with a note from Juliet&mdash;she had ceased to send
      the Nurse on discovering her lover's antipathy to that person&mdash;and
      some minutes later either Gregory or Peter might have been observed coming
      down the staircase with a missive from Hamlet. Juliet had detected his
      gift for verse, and insisted, rather capriciously, on having all his
      replies in that shape. Hamlet humored her, though he was often hard put to
      it; for the Muse is a coy immortal, and will not always come when she is
      wanted. Sometimes he was forced to fall back upon previous efforts, as
      when he translated these lines into very choice Italian:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Doubt thou the stars are fire,
          Doubt that the sun doth move;
     Doubt Truth to be a liar,
          But never doubt I love.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To be sure, he had originally composed this quatrain for Ophelia; but what
      would you have? He had scarcely meant it then; he meant it now; besides, a
      felicitous rhyme never goes out of fashion. It always fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      While transcribing the verse his thoughts naturally reverted to Ophelia,
      for the little poesy was full of a faint scent of the past, like a pressed
      flower. His conscience did not prick him at all. How fortunate for him and
      for her that matters had gone no further between them? Predisposed to
      melancholy, and inheriting a not very strong mind from her father, Ophelia
      was a lady who needed cheering up, if ever poor lady did. He, Hamlet, was
      the last man on the globe with whom she should have had any tender
      affiliation. If they had wed, they would have caught each other's
      despondency, and died, like a pair of sick ravens, within a fortnight.
      What had become of her? Had she gone into a nunnery? He would make her
      abbess, if he ever returned to Elsinore.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a month or two of courtship, there being no earthly reason to
      prolong it, Hamlet and Juliet were privately married in the Franciscan
      Chapel, Friar Laurence officiating; but there was a grand banquet that
      night at the Capulets', to which all Verona went. At Hamlet's
      intercession, the Montagues were courteously asked to this festival. To
      the amazement of every one the Montagues accepted the invitation and came,
      and were treated royally, and the long, lamentable feud&mdash;it would
      have sorely puzzled either house to explain what it was all about&mdash;was
      at an end. The adherents of the Capulets and the Montagues were forbidden
      on the spot to bite any more thumbs at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will detract from the general gayety of the town,&rdquo; Mercutio remarked.
      &ldquo;Signior Tybalt, my friend, I shall never have the pleasure of running you
      through the diaphragm; a cup of wine with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests were still at supper in the great pavilion erected in the
      garden, which was as light as day with the glare of innumerable flambeaux
      set among the shrubbery. Hamlet and Juliet, with several others, had
      withdrawn from the tables, and were standing in the doorway of the
      pavilion, when Hamlet's glance fell upon the familiar form of a young man
      who stood with one foot on the lower step, holding his plumed bonnet in
      his hand. His hose and doublet were travel-worn, but his honest face was
      as fresh as daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Horatio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my good friend: I 'll change that name with you. What brings you to
      Verona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fetch you news, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news? Then the king is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king lives, but Ophelia is no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ophelia dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, my lord; she 's married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I do live, my honored lord, 't is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married to him that sent me hither&mdash;a gentleman of winning ways and
      a most choice conceit, the scion of a noble house here in Verona&mdash;one
      Romeo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oddest little expression flitted over Juliet's face. There was never
      woman yet, even on her bridal day, could forgive a jilted lover marrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ophelia wed!&rdquo; murmured the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the lady, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent well,&rdquo; replied Hamlet, turning to Juliet; &ldquo;a most estimable
      young person, the daughter of my father's chamberlain. She is rather given
      to singing ballads of an elegiac nature,&rdquo; added the prince, reflectingly,
      &ldquo;but our madcap Romeo will cure her of that. Methinks I see them now&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, where, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my mind's eye, Horatio, surrounded by their little ones&mdash;noble
      youths and graceful maidens, in whom the impetuosity of the fiery Romeo is
      tempered by the pensiveness of the fair Ophelia. I shall take it most
      unkindly of them, love,&rdquo; toying with Juliet's fingers, &ldquo;if they do not
      name their first boy Hamlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just as my lord Hamlet finished speaking that the last horse-car
      for Boston&mdash;providentially belated between Water-town and Mount
      Auburn&mdash;swept round the curve of the track on which I was walking.
      The amber glow of the car-lantern lighted up my figure in the gloom, the
      driver gave a quick turn on the brake, and the conductor, making a sudden
      dexterous clutch at the strap over his head, sounded the death-knell of my
      fantasy as I stepped upon the rear platform.
